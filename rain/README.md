Rain Project
## Overview

### Directory: rain/
### File: 0-rain.py
- Description: A Python script that calculates the total amount of rainwater      retained between walls, represented as a list of non-negative integers. Each integer indicates the height of a wall with unit width 1, and the script computes the water trapped in "valleys" between walls.

## Problem Details

- Task: Implement the rain(walls) function to return the total units of rainwater retained.
- Input: A list of non-negative integers (walls).
- Output: An integer representing the total water retained.
- Constraints:
- Ends of the list (before index 0 and after the last index) are not walls and do -
  not retain water.
